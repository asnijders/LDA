# Latent Dirichlet Allocation
This repository implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation in Python 3, using strictly Python/NumPy routines.

Current version supports:
- Gibbs Sampling

I might expand the code at a later point such that the model can also use black-box inference to model the posterior distribution.

I largely relied on the following two resources for implementing this algorithm:
- A Theoretical and Practical ImplementationTutorial on Topic Modeling and Gibbs Sampling
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation Using Gibbs Sampling
